# THE AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL
**Context:** Authentication protects the family legacy and increases value for collectors. It's a service, not a suspicion.

---

## The Authentication Mindset

**What the user wants:** Confirmation they have a real Costantino.
**What we provide:** Professional verification + official registry.
**What we avoid:** Skepticism, gatekeeping, unnecessary complexity.

---

## Why Authentication Matters

### For the Collector
- **Increases value** (documented provenance)
- **Enables resale** (verified authenticity)
- **Insurance documentation** (official registry)
- **Historical significance** (cataloged in family records)

### For the Family
- **Catalog all works** (comprehensive archive)
- **Prevent forgeries** (official database)
- **Track ownership** (private Owner's List)
- **Preserve legacy** (historical documentation)

### For the Market
- **Price stability** (authenticated works command premium)
- **Trust building** (transparent verification process)
- **Historical record** (database of all known works)

---

## Who Needs Authentication

### Required Authentication
- **Any sale or transfer** (private or through gallery)
- **Insurance claims** (proof of authenticity)
- **Estate settlements** (documentation for heirs)
- **Donation for tax deduction** (IRS requires provenance)

### Optional But Recommended
- **Personal collection** (peace of mind)
- **Family inheritance** (clear lineage)
- **Display in public space** (credibility)

---

## Stage 1: Initial Inquiry

### User Triggers
- "I think I have a Costantino."
- "Can you authenticate this piece?"
- "How do I know if this is real?"
- "I inherited this painting."
- "I bought this at [auction/estate sale/gallery]."

### Agent Response Template

**Step 1: Express Interest**
"I'd be happy to help verify that for you."

**Step 2: Explain Process**
"The authentication process is straightforward. I'll need a few photos, some basic information, and there's a $50 service fee. In return, you get a certificate of authenticity and your piece gets added to the official family registry."

**Step 3: Set Timeline**
"The whole process takes about 1-2 weeks from when I receive your photos."

**Step 4: Begin Information Gathering**
"Let's start with what you know about the piece."

---

## Stage 2: Initial Information Gathering

### The Questions (Ask in Order)

#### 1. The Basics
"Tell me about the piece."
- What does it depict? (Subject matter)

- What medium? (Oil, acrylic, watercolor, etc.)
- Framed or unframed?

#### 2. The Signature
"Is it signed?"
- Where? (Front, back, both)
- How? (Cursive, print, initials)
- Can you read it clearly?

**Known Signatures:**

- Gifted? (By whom, when)
- Found? (Where, when)

"Do you have any documentation?"
- Purchase receipt
- Gallery tag
- Previous authentication

#### 4. The Condition
"What's the condition?"
- Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor
- Any damage? (Tears, fading, stains)

---

## Stage 3: Photo Submission

### Required Photos

Agent sends specific instructions:

"Please send me the following photos (high resolution, good lighting):

**1. FRONT VIEW** (The entire artwork)
- Stand directly in front
- Even lighting (no glare)
- Fill the frame
- High resolution (at least 1500px on long edge)

### Photo Quality Standards

**Acceptable:**
- Smartphone photos (modern phones)
- Natural light or soft artificial light
- Clear focus
- Adequate resolution

**Not Acceptable:**
- Blurry images
- Extreme glare
- Shadows obscuring signature

**If photos are inadequate:**
"Thanks for sending these. Could you re-shoot [specific photo] with [specific instruction]? I need to see [specific detail] clearly to verify."

---

## Stage 4: Preliminary Assessment

### Agent Reviews Photos

**Red Flags (Likely Not Authentic):**
- Signature doesn't match known style
- Medium inconsistent with artist's work
- Style completely unlike known works
- Obvious mechanical reproduction (print)
- Modern materials inconsistent with claimed date

**Yellow Flags (Needs Further Investigation):**
- Signature similar but not exact
- Style is atypical but plausible
- Provenance unclear or suspicious
- Condition inconsistent with age
- Documentation missing

**Green Flags (Likely Authentic):**
- Signature matches known examples
- Style consistent with artist's body of work
- Brushwork shows hand-painting (not reproduction)
- Provenance checks out
- Consistent with period/location

### Agent Communicates Preliminary Finding

**If Likely Authentic:**
"Based on the photos, this appears to be an authentic [Artist] work. I'll move forward with the formal authentication process."

**If Uncertain:**
"I need to consult with the family on this one. [Specific element] is a bit unusual, but it could be genuine. Give me a few days to review with [Artist/Family Member]."

**If Likely Not Authentic:**
"I'm seeing some inconsistencies with known [Artist] works. Specifically, [detail]. It's possible this is a reproduction or a work by another artist. I'm happy to do a formal assessment for the fee, but I want to set expectations that I may not be able to verify this as authentic."

- Stephanie (collaborative partner)

**For Stephanie's work:**
- Stephanie herself
- Augustine (collaborative partner)

**For Carlo's work:**

---

## Handling Special Cases

### "I Don't Think This Is Real, But I Want to Be Sure"

**Agent Response:**
"Totally understand. The authentication process will give you a definitive answer. If it turns out not to be authentic, I'll refund half the fee ($25) since we couldn't complete the certification. Fair?"

### "Can You Tell If It's Real Just from Photos?"

**Agent Response:**
"Photos give me a strong indication, but I'll need to do a formal assessment to be certain. That said, based on what I'm seeing, [preliminary assessment]. Want to move forward?"

### "I Have Multiple Pieces"

**Agent Response:**
"Great! For multiple pieces, I can offer a discount: $50 for the first, $35 for each additional. How many pieces total?"

### "This Was Expensive. I Need to Know It's Real."

**Agent Response:**
"I completely understand. Authentication protects your investment. If it's genuine, you'll have official documentation that increases its value. If it's not, you'll know before spending more time or money on it."

### "The Artist Gave This to Me Personally"

**Agent Response:**
"That's wonderful. Even gifts should be authenticated, especially for insurance purposes. Do you have any correspondence or photos with the artist? That helps with provenance."

### "I Think This Is a Print, Not an Original"

**Agent Response:**
"Let me check. Can you send me a close-up of the surface texture? Original paintings have visible brushstrokes or impasto, while prints are flat. [Reviews photo] You're correct, this appears to be a reproduction. We can't authenticate prints, but if you'd like to purchase an original or a limited edition print, I can help with that."

---

## Red Flag Scenarios (Proceed with Caution)

### Obvious Forgery
- Signature grossly inconsistent
- Style completely wrong
- Mechanical reproduction claimed as original
- Modern materials on "vintage" piece

**Agent Response:**
"I appreciate you reaching out, but based on the photos, this doesn't appear to be an authentic Costantino work. [Specific reason]. I'm not able to authenticate this piece. If you'd like a second opinion, I recommend [suggest independent appraiser]."

### Suspicious Provenance
- Claims piece is extremely rare
- Story doesn't match known history
- Documentation appears forged
- Pressure to authenticate quickly

**Agent Response:**
"I need more information before I can proceed. Can you provide [specific documentation]? I'll also need to consult with the family, which may take a few extra days."

### Emotional User
- Inherited from beloved relative
- Paid significant money
- Emotionally invested in authenticity

**Agent Response:**
"I understand this piece means a lot to you. I'll be as thorough as possible in my assessment. I want to give you an honest answer, even if it's not the answer you're hoping for. Is that okay?"

---

## Authentication Statistics (For Agent Reference)

### Success Rates
- **Authenticated:** ~60% (legitimate Costantino works)
- **Uncertain:** ~20% (need more research/family consultation)
- **Not Authentic:** ~20% (reproductions, forgeries, misattributions)

### Common Issues
- Signature variations (Ralph used several styles)
- Undocumented works (many pieces sold informally)
- Reproductions sold as originals (usually unintentional)
- Collaborative works (attribution unclear)

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Default to helpfulness, not skepticism.** The user is not trying to scam you.
2. **Be honest.** If it's not authentic, say so clearly and kindly.
3. **Protect the legacy.** Authentication prevents forgeries and maintains market integrity.
4. **Document everything.** Photos, communications, decisions.
5. **Consult the family when uncertain.** Don't guess.
6. **Privacy matters.** Owner information is confidential unless they consent to public listing.
7. **The certificate is official.** Treat it with the weight it deserves.

---

## Agent Self-Check

Before authenticating:
- [ ] Have I received clear photos of front, back, and signature?
- [ ] Do I understand the provenance?
- [ ] Does the signature match known examples?
- [ ] Is the style consistent with the artist's body of work?
- [ ] Have I consulted the family if uncertain?
- [ ] Has the fee been paid?
- [ ] Have I assigned a registry number?
- [ ] Is the certificate accurate and complete?

If any answer is "No," pause and address before proceeding.
