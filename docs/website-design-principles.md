# On Website Design

Design a website like you'd design a conversation. Every element has a job. Hierarchy matters. Whitespace is not empty space—it's breathing room.

Start with clarity, not decoration. Users come to do something. Make that thing obvious. First impression should tell them exactly what this is and why they're here. No mystery hooks. No cryptic navigation.

Contrast is your core tool. Important things pop. Less important things recede. Use color, size, weight, position. Make it obvious what to click and what to read. Avoid medium gray on medium gray because it looks sophisticated. It just looks broken.

Typography carries meaning. Pick two typefaces maximum. One for structure. One for reading. Kerning matters. Line height matters. Make paragraphs breathable—not text blocks that exhaust you. 40-70 characters per line works. Shorter on mobile.

Whitespace compounds beauty. More whitespace than you think. More than feels comfortable at first. Then you realize it's why things feel elegant instead of cramped.

Every interaction should be instant or show progress. Buttons that respond on click. Loading states that explain what's happening. Hover states that confirm the target. Make friction visible, then eliminate it.

Mobile-first. Design for 375px width first. Then add features for bigger screens. Responsive isn't an afterthought. It's the foundation.

Navigation should never require thinking. Users should never need to hunt for where they are or how to get back. Breadcrumbs, clear headers, consistent patterns.

Color psychology works but subtly. Don't rely on it. Use it to reinforce what structure already communicates. Primary action gets accent color. That's usually enough.

Accessibility isn't separate from design. It's good design. Sufficient contrast helps everyone. Clear labels help everyone. Keyboard navigation helps everyone. Make it work for people with vision loss, hearing loss, or motor challenges. The designs that work best for them often work best for everyone.

Test with real users doing real tasks. Not asking for feedback. Watching them navigate without guidance. Where do they get confused? Where do they hesitate? That's your data.

Animations should have purpose. They guide attention or show state change. Not performance art. If you remove the animation and nothing breaks, remove it.

Forms are conversations. One thing per screen when possible. Progressive disclosure. Only ask for what you need right now. Errors should explain exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. Not "Invalid input." Say why.

Consistency is architecture. Same button style everywhere. Same spacing ratios. Same interaction patterns. Users learn your system once, then they can navigate anything in it.

Speed matters psychologically. 3 seconds load time is different from 1 second. People feel it as broken. Optimize images aggressively. Minimize animations on first load. Cache what you can. Every millisecond counts.

Dark mode isn't just an aesthetic choice. Some users need it. Build it in from the start, not as a toggle afterthought.

Test for actual usage. Real internet speeds. Real devices. Real browsers. Pixel-perfect on your 5K display means nothing if it breaks on an iPhone.

The best designs disappear. Users don't think about the design. They just get what they came for.
