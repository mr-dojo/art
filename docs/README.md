## Documentation Philosophy

**Documentation as Infrastructure**: These documents aren't passive reference material—they're the actual system specification. When a Claude Code agent needs to build, maintain, or operate the Costantino Art website, these documents provide the complete context.

**The Core Idea**: If natural language is the interface, documentation is the code. The clearer the context, the better the output.

## Guidelines

When adding new documentation:
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Write in Markdown format
- Keep documents focused on a single topic
- Include examples where helpful
- Update this README when adding new documents
