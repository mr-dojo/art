# THE ARTIST PROFILES
**Context:** These are not biographies. They are context cards. Use them to explain why the art looks the way it does. Nothing more.

## CALOGERO COSTANTINO (1879-?)
**Role:** The Foundation
**Medium:** Hand-forged iron, architectural metalwork
**Active:** 1920s-1950s
**Location:** Palermo → Hollywood Hills

### What Matters
- Fled Sicily to escape the Black Hand (Sicilian mafia)
- Built ornamental ironwork for early Hollywood homes (Outpost Estates)
- Worked in secret—name never on blueprints
- Created the "Costantino scroll"—a curve motif that runs through four generations

### The DNA
**Structural thinking.** Everything he made was permanent. Heavy. Deliberate. That weight shows up in the family's work even now—the thick brushstrokes, the bold lines, the confidence.

### When to Reference
- User asks about "the scroll" or curved motifs
- User asks about family history
- You're explaining why a painting feels "architectural"

### One-Line Story
"The curves in this painting started as iron gates in 1920s Hollywood."

## SALVATORE "SAM" COSTANTINO (1920s-1970s)
**Role:** The Bridge
**Medium:** Industrial ironwork
**Active:** 1930s-1970s
**Location:** San Diego → Houston

### What Matters
- Son of Calogero
- Worked at larger scale: zoo cages, raceway gates
- Invented a fire safety quick-release for window guards
- Shifted from decorative to functional/protective ironwork

### The DNA
**Safety and structure.** His work protected things. That shows up in the family as "grounding"—even the wildest abstracts have structural integrity.

### When to Reference
- User asks about ironwork connection
- You're explaining the family's craft background
- Rarely (he's the bridge generation, less visual in the current collection)

### One-Line Story
"He built the cages at the San Diego Zoo. Same precision, bigger scale."

## RALPH COSTANTINO (1929-2001)
**Role:** The Explosion
**Medium:** Oil, acrylic, mixed media
**Active:** 1950s-2001
**Location:** Houston → San Diego → Lahaina, Maui

### What Matters
- **Gulf Coast Era (1950s-1980s):** Darker, moodier, jazz-influenced
- **Maui Era (1981-2001):** Color explosion—vibrant, tropical
- Played percussion with Cal Tjader and Chet Baker (jazz drummer)
- Philosophy: "Make a mess, then fix it"
- Color was his "forte"
- Used the scroll motif from his father's ironwork

### The DNA
**Fearless color.** He wasn't afraid of the canvas. He painted the way he played drums—rhythm, improvisation, confidence. That boldness is in every family member after him.

### Signature Elements
- Scrollwork (ironwork heritage)
- Large, deep eyes in portraits
- Thick, confident brushstrokes
- Color mastery (especially after Maui)

### When to Reference
- User asks about color
- User asks about "jazz" influence
- You're showing a Ralph piece
- You're explaining Augustine's or Carlo's fearlessness

### Key Stories to Use

**The Color Shift:**
"Ralph's palette changed completely when he moved to Maui in 1981. Compare the Houston work (dark, moody) to the island work (electric, vibrant). Same artist, different light."

**The Jazz Connection:**
"Ralph played percussion with jazz legends. You can see the rhythm in his brushwork—syncopated, improvisational."

**The Scroll:**
"That curve? His grandfather forged that into iron gates. Ralph painted it."

### One-Line Story
"Jazz drummer turned painter. You can see the rhythm."

- Began painting after Ralph's death in 2001
- Lives in Ralph's former studio on Front Street, Lahaina

### Signature Elements

**The Studio:**
"He paints in his father's old studio in Lahaina. Same light. Same island. Different generation."

**The Fish:**
"The Lahaina Fish series is his signature. Each one is built like a mosaic—geometric patterns, vibrant color, playful energy."

**The Balance:**
"Where Augustine is electric, Stephanie is air. They balance each other."

### One-Line Story
"Ohio mist meets Maui vibrance. She brings the atmosphere."

## CARLO COSTANTINO (1990s-Present)
**Role:** The Digital Native
**Also Known As:** Mr. Dojo
**Medium:** Digital painting, acrylic on canvas
**Active:** 2010s-Present

- Full-stack web developer + artist
- Partially colorblind → unique, vivid palettes
- "Text-first approach" to creativity

- Stylized portraiture
- Abstract expressionist backgrounds
- Fauvism/Pop Art influences
- Digital + traditional mixed

### When to Reference

- You're showing a Carlo piece

### Key Stories to Use

**The Colorblind Painter:**
"Carlo is partially colorblind. That's why his color palette is so distinct—he sees differently, so he paints differently."

**The Digital Bridge:**
"Fifth generation, same fearless approach. Mouse instead of brush, but the DNA is the same."

**The Tech + Art:**
"Carlo codes websites and paints. Both are about building something from nothing."

### One-Line Story
"Fifth generation. Mouse instead of brush. Same fearlessness."

## COLLABORATIVE WORK (Augustine + Stephanie)

### What Matters
- Some pieces are collaborative
- Augustine's bold strokes + Stephanie's atmosphere
- "A friendly pull and tug of rich and delicate, bold and fun"

### How to Identify
- Look for dual signatures or attribution
- Stylistic blend: electric + soft
- Usually larger pieces

### When to Reference
- User asks about a collaborative piece
- You're explaining their creative partnership
- User wants "the best of both worlds"

### One-Line Story
"Some pieces are a duet. His energy, her air."

## Agent Usage Rules

### DO:
- Use profiles to explain visual elements
- Keep references brief (one sentence max)
- Focus on what the user can see in the work
- Connect biography to style only when relevant

### DON'T:
- Dump full biography
- Lead with history instead of art
- Use profiles as sales pitch
- Mention details that don't affect the art (e.g., number of children, unrelated jobs)

### Decision Tree

**User asks:** "Who is this artist?"
**Agent responds:** "[Artist name]. [One-line DNA]. This piece is from [era/series]."

**User asks:** "Tell me more about them."
**Agent responds:** "[Key story that explains what they're looking at]. Would you like to see more from this period?"

**User asks:** "What's their background?"
**Agent responds:** "[Relevant background only]. That's why this work has [specific visual element]."

## The Golden Rule

**Biography serves the art. Never the reverse.**

If the user's looking at an Augustine fish painting, they don't need to know he was a minister for nine years. They need to know he was a surfer—because that explains the flow.
