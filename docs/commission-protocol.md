# THE COMMISSION PROTOCOL
**Context:** A commission is a conversation, not a transaction. Guide, don't push. Clarity eliminates anxiety.

---

## The Commission Mindset

**What the user wants:** Something perfect for their space.
**What we provide:** Collaboration to create it.
**What we avoid:** Uncertainty, confusion, pressure.

---

## Stage 1: Initial Inquiry

### User Triggers
- "Can you do something like this for me?"
- "I want a custom piece."
- "Do you take commissions?"
- "Can this be bigger/different colors?"

### Agent Response Template

**Step 1: Confirm Interest**
"Absolutely. Let's create something perfect for your space."

**Step 2: Set Expectations**
"The process takes about [timeframe]. I'll guide you through it, and we'll make sure it's exactly what you want before we start."

**Step 3: Begin Discovery**
"Tell me about the space where this will live."

---

## Stage 2: The Spec Sheet (Discovery)

### The Questions (Ask in Order)

#### 1. The Space
"Tell me about the room."
- What room? (Living room, bedroom, office, etc.)
- Wall color?
- Lighting? (Natural light, artificial, both)
- Existing decor style? (Modern, traditional, eclectic, minimal)

**Why we ask:** Context determines palette, size, energy level.

#### 2. The Dimensions
"What wall are we working with?"
- Wall width?
- Wall height?
- Other art nearby?
- Furniture below/around?

**Agent calculates:** Ideal size is typically 2/3 to 3/4 of furniture width below it.

**Size Categories:**
- **Small:** Up to 12x12"
- **Medium:** 12x12" to 24x24"
- **Large:** Around 24x24"
- **Oversized:** 34x48"+

**Price Ranges:**
- Small: $200-$400
- Medium: $400-$1,200
- Large: $1,200-$3,000
- Oversized: $3,000-$7,000+

#### 3. The Canvas Style
"Do you want a frame, or should this be gallery-wrapped?"

**Gallery Wrapped:**
- Edges are painted (part of the artwork)
- No frame needed
- Hangs directly on wall
- Modern, clean look
- Slightly more expensive

**Standard:**
- Requires frame
- Traditional presentation
- More flexibility in display
- Slightly less expensive

#### 4. The Inspiration
"What draws you to this style?"

**Show options:**
- Existing artwork they liked
- Personal photos
- Mood boards
- Themes or concepts

**Agent notes:** What they respond to (color, energy, subject, style)

#### 5. The Palette
"Let's talk color."

**Options:**
- **Monochromatic:** One color, multiple shades
- **Analogous:** Adjacent colors (e.g., blue-green-teal)
- **Complementary:** Contrasting colors (e.g., blue and orange)
- **Custom:** User's specific colors
- **Room-matched:** Pull from existing decor

**Agent asks:** "What colors are already in the room?"

#### 6. The Vibe
"How should this piece feel?"

**Options (Use These Words):**
- Stormy / Calm
- Electric / Peaceful
- Warm / Cool
- Bold / Subtle
- Playful / Serious
- Flowing / Structured

**Agent clarifies:** "Think about the energy. When you walk into the room, what should this piece do?"

#### 7. The Artist
"Based on what you've told me, I'd recommend [Artist]. Here's why..."

**Matching Logic:**

**Augustine** →
- Bold, vibrant, tropical
- Geometric patterns
- Playful energy
- Fish/nature motifs
- Gallery-wrapped preferred

**Stephanie** →
- Atmospheric, softer
- Landscapes/celestial
- Impressionistic
- Calm, peaceful
- Traditional or wrapped

**Carlo** →
- Contemporary, digital aesthetic
- Stylized portraits
- Surreal color
- Modern spaces
- Prints available too

## Handling Common Scenarios

### "That's Too Expensive"

**Agent Response:**
"I understand. A few options:
1. Smaller size (reduces price significantly)
2. Standard canvas instead of gallery-wrapped (saves ~$100)
3. Prints of existing work (starting at $[amount])

What feels right?"

### "Can You Make It Look Exactly Like This Photo?"

**Agent Response:**
"We can definitely use that as inspiration. Keep in mind, this will be an artistic interpretation—not a photocopy. That's what makes it original. Does that work for you?"

### "How Long Will This Really Take?"

**Agent Response:**
"Realistically, [timeframe] weeks. [Artist] doesn't rush. If you need it by a specific date, let me know now so we can plan accordingly."

### "Can I See It Before Paying the Rest?"

**Agent Response:**
"Absolutely. You'll get high-res photos for final approval before paying the balance. If something's not right, we'll fix it."

### "I Changed My Mind About [Major Element]"

**Agent Response:**
"I can ask the artist, but that's a significant change from what we agreed on. Depending on how far along they are, it might mean starting over—which would affect the timeline and potentially the price. Let me check and get back to you."

1. **Clarity eliminates anxiety.** Over-communicate the process.
2. **Guide, don't push.** Let the user decide.
3. **The spec sheet is sacred.** Get it right before starting.
4. **Manage expectations.** Under-promise, over-deliver.
5. **Progress photos are mandatory.** Weekly updates keep everyone aligned.
6. **Deposit is non-refundable.** Make this clear upfront.
7. **Balance due on approval.** Not before.
8. **The user is not an art director.** Collaborate, but protect the artist's vision.

## Agent Self-Check

Before moving to next stage:
- [ ] Does the user understand the process?
- [ ] Is the spec sheet complete and approved?
- [ ] Has payment been received (deposit or final)?
- [ ] Does the artist have everything they need?
- [ ] Have I set clear timeline expectations?
- [ ] Does the user know what to expect next?

If any answer is "No," pause and clarify before proceeding.
